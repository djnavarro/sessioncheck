The goal of **sessioncheck** is to provide simple tools that can be called at the top of a script, and produce warnings or errors if it detects signs that the script is not being executed in a clean R session. The intended user for **sessioncheck** is a beginner or intermediate level R user who has learned enough about R to understand the limitations of using `rm(list = ls())` as a method to clean the R session, but is perhaps not at the point that they can take advantage of sophisticated tools like [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/), [callr](https://callr.r-lib.org/), and so on. 

## Why is this important?

A common practice when writing R scripts is to include a snippet of code like `rm(list = ls())` at the top of the script. The reason people do this is for reproducibility purposes, to ensure that the script is run in the context of a "clean" R session. The goal is a good one, but the method used to attain it is not very effective. The only thing that `rm(list = ls())` does is remove any variables currently stored in the global environment, but this is only one of many different ways in which previously-executed code can alter the state of the R session. This approach doesn't provide any degree of safety from any of the following:

- packages that may have been loaded with `library()` and change which functions get executed by your code
- data sets or other environments that may have been added to the search path with `attach()` and alter the variables and functions that are visible to your code
- options that may have been set with `options()` and can alter how your code is interpreted 
- "hidden" variables in the global environment like `.Random.seed` that affect R code execution and are ignored by `rm(list = ls())`
- ...and many more; there's a long list of subtler ways in which the R session state matters

Any of these can affect how your script executes, and `rm(list = ls())` does not protect you against any of them. Because of this, a better practice is to **restart the R session** immediately before running the script. By running the script in a fresh R session, you're much less likely to encounter these issues. By exension, the reason for including a call to `sessioncheck()` at the top of a script is to **prompt the user** when potential issues are detected. 

For additional background see the article on [why session checking is useful](https://sessioncheck.djnavarro.net/articles/why-check-the-r-session.html).


## How does sessioncheck work?

The **sessioncheck** package is built on several functions that each check one specific aspect to the R session: the `sessioncheck()` function itself merely aggregates the results of the individual checks. 

When calling `sessioncheck()` you can customise exactly which checks are performed and what rules should apply to each check, but for now let's look at the three specific checks that are performed by default: checks of the global environment, checks of the attached packages, and checks of the attached non-package environments. These can be run as standalone checks using `check_globalenv()`, `check_packages()` and `check_attachments()`, so the natural place to start is examining the behaviour of the standalone checks. 

### Check 1: global environment

The first and simplest of the checks is `check_globalenv()`, and it focuses on the same aspect of the R session that the traditional `rm(list=ls())` method does: the contents of the global environment. At the moment there is nothing in the global environment, so it is considered "clean". As a consequence, nothing happens when we run this check:

```{r}
#| label: check-globalenv
sessioncheck::check_globalenv()
```

To get the check to produce a warning, we'll need to add some variables:

```{r}
visible_1 <- "this will get detected"
visible_2 <- "so will this"
.hidden_1 <- "but this will not"

sessioncheck::check_globalenv()
```

The output indicates that the script has detected `visible_1` and `visible_2` in the global environment, and issues a warning to suggest that the R session may be contaminated.

There are two arguments to `check_globalenv()`:

- `action` specifies what the function should do if an issue is detected. There are four allowed values: `error`, `warn` (the default), `message`, and `none`.
- `allow` is a character vector used to specify the rules that are used to decide *which* objects should trigger an action. A variable name that is included in the `allow` list will not trigger an action. There is a special case: `allow = NULL` will apply the same rule that `ls()` uses when listing the contents of the global environment: variables that start with a `.` will be ignored, and will not trigger an action. 

The example below illustrates how both of these actions are used. Here, the action taken will be to print a message rather than a warning; and by setting the `allow` argument to an empty string, *any* variable in the global environment will trigger the message, even the "hidden" ones:

```{r}
sessioncheck::check_globalenv(action = "message", allow = "")
```

This time we notice that the check detects the `visible_1` and `visible_2` like last time, but it now detects two hidden variables: the `.hidden_1` variable that I created earlier, and also the `.Random.seed` variable that R uses to store the state of the random number generator.

### Check 2: attached packages



```{r}
#| label: check-packages
sessioncheck::check_packages()
```

The warning notes that the **sessioncheck** package has been attached. This might be considered acceptable, so we can ask the check to `allow` this package:

```{r}
sessioncheck::check_packages(action = "warn", allow = "sessioncheck")
```

### Check 3: other attachments

```{r}
#| label: check-attachments
sessioncheck::check_attachments()
```


### Other checks

There are other checks that are not called by default. One is an "allow list" check, where the user must specify exactly which entities are permitted (i.e. the list of things that *don't* trigger an action):

- `check_namespaces()` looks for packages that have been loaded but not attached 

The others are "block list" checks, where the user specifies which cases are to be blocked (i.e., the list of things that *do* trigger an action) 

- TODO: `check_options()` looks for specific options that might be of concern
- TODO: `check_sysenv()` looks for system environment variables
