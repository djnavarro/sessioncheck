\title{Check global environment and attached environments}
\usage{
check_globalenv(action = "warn", allow = NULL)

check_attachments(action = "warn", allow = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{action}{Behaviour to take if the status is not clean. Possible values are
"error", "warn", "message", and "none". The default is \code{action = "warn"}.}

\item{allow}{Character vector containing names of objects or environments
that are "allowed", and will not trigger an action.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a status vector, a logical vector with names referring
to a detected entity (e.g., object, or environment). Values are \code{TRUE} if
the entity is ignored, \code{FALSE} if it triggers an action.
}
\description{
Individual session check functions that inspect the contents of the global
environment and the names of attached non-package environments. Session checkers
can produce errors, warnings, or messages if requested.
}
\details{
The default behaviour of the \code{allow} argument is slightly for each checker:
\itemize{
\item \code{check_globalenv()}: This checker inspects the state of the global environment
and takes action based on the objects found there. When \code{allow = NULL}, variables
in the global environment will not trigger an action if the name starts with a dot.
For example, \code{.Random.seed} and \code{.Last.value} do not trigger actions by default.
\item \code{check_attachments()}: This checker inspects all environments on the search
path. This includes attached packages, anything added using \code{attach()}, and the
global environment. When \code{allow = NULL}, package environents do not trigger an
action, nor do "tools:rstudio", "tools:positron", "tools:callr", or "Autoloads".
The global environment and the package environment for the \strong{base} package
never trigger actions.
}
