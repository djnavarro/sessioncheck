\title{Check specific aspects to the R session}
\usage{
check_globalenv(action = "warn", ignore = NULL)

check_packages(action = "warn", ignore = NULL)

check_namespaces(action = "warn", ignore = NULL)

check_attachments(action = "warn", ignore = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{action}{Behaviour to take if the status is not clean. Possible values are
"error", "warn", "message", and "none". The default is \code{action = "warn"}.}

\item{ignore}{Character vector containing names of objects, packages, environment
names that will not trigger an action. Some entities will never trigger actions
(see details).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a status vector, a logical vector with names referring
to a detected entity (e.g., object, package, environment). Values are \code{TRUE} if
the entity is ignored, \code{FALSE} if it triggers an action.
}
\description{
Individual session check functions that each inspect one way in which an R
session could be considered not to be "clean". Session checkers can produce
errors, warnings, or messages if requested.
}
\details{
The default behaviour of the \code{ignore} argument is slightly for each checker:
\itemize{
\item \code{check_globalenv()}: This checker inspects the state of the global environment
and takes action based on the objects found there. When \code{ignore = NULL}, variables
in the global environment will be ignored if the name starts with a dot. For
example, \code{.Random.seed} and \code{.Last.value} no not trigger actions by default.
\item \code{check_packages()}: This checker inspects the list of packages that have been
attached to the search path (e.g., via \code{library()}). Regardless of the value of
ignore, R packages that have "base" priority (e.g., \strong{base}, \strong{utils}, and
\strong{grDevices}) do not trigger an action. When \code{ignore = NULL} these are the only
packages that are ignored.
\item \code{check_namespaces()}: This checker inspects the list of loaded namespaces (e.g.
packages that have been loaded but not attached). The \code{ignore} argument for this
checker is almost identical to \code{check_packages()}: the only difference is that
the \strong{sessioncheck} package is never flagged, since the namespace must be loaded
in order to call the function.
\item \code{check_attachments()}: This checker inspects all environments on the search
path. This includes attached packages, anything added using \code{attach()}, and the
global environment. When \code{ignore = NULL}, package environents do not trigger an
action, nor do "tools:rstudio", "tools:positron", or "Autoloads". The global
environment and the package environment for the \strong{base} package never trigger
actions.
