<p>A common practice when writing R scripts is to include a snippet of
code like <code>rm(list = ls())</code> at the top of the script. The
reason people do this is for reproducibility purposes, to ensure that
the script is run in the context of a “clean” R session. The goal is a
good one, but the method used to attain it is not very effective. The
only thing that <code>rm(list = ls())</code> does is remove any
variables currently stored in the global environment, but this is only
one of many different ways in which previously-executed code can alter
the state of the R session. This approach doesn’t provide any degree of
safety from any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>packages that may have been loaded with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library()</a></code> and
change which functions get executed by your code</li>
<li>data sets or other environments that may have been added to the
search path with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/attach.html" class="external-link">attach()</a></code> and alter the variables and
functions that are visible to your code</li>
<li>options that may have been set with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/options.html" class="external-link">options()</a></code> and can
alter how your code is interpreted</li>
<li>“hidden” variables in the global environment like
<code>.Random.seed</code> that affect R code execution and are ignored
by <code>rm(list = ls())</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it’s enough to illustrate
the many different factors that can can affect how your script executes:
<code>rm(list = ls())</code> does not protect you against any of them.
Jenny Bryan provides a good discussion of the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/" class="external-link">problems
with the “object nuking” approach</a> on the tidyverse blog.</p>
<p>Because of this, a better practice is to <strong>restart the R
session</strong> immediately before running the script. By running the
script in a fresh R session, you’re much less likely to encounter these
issues.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="how-does-sessioncheck-help">How does sessioncheck help?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-does-sessioncheck-help"></a>
</h2>
<p>The principle that underpins <strong>sessioncheck</strong> is that
scripts should not attempt a “clean up” of the environment. The “state”
of an R session is complicated, and so if your script detects evidence
that the pre-existing R state isn’t “clean”, the thing it should do is
produce an error – it is the users responsibility to ensure a clean
session. The script itself doesn’t have the power to make that happen,
and it shouldn’t try.</p>
<p>If you accept this as the core principle, then the thing you want to
do – within that little snippet of code you insert at the top of the
script – is to have your script look at the state of the R session, and
look for signs that it isn’t being run in a clean environment. If it
detects any such signs, it should warn the user, or (in cases where
strict controls are required) produce an error that prevents the rest of
the script from running. The purpose of <strong>sessioncheck</strong> is
to provide tools that can do this. They are – necessarily! – based on
heuristic rules that scan the session for signs that there might be an
issue, so it will not be perfect. But at a bare minimum it can be
guaranteed that this approach is strictly superior to using
<code>rm(list = ls())</code>.</p>
<p>The core idea is very simple. In the typical case, you wouldn’t load
the package with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library()</a></code>. Instead, you would put this as
the very line of their R script:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">sessioncheck</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/sessioncheck.html">sessioncheck</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"error"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When executed in a clean R session this function does nothing, and
the script continues to run as it normally would. However, if the
session is “contaminated” – for some specific interpretation of what
that means to call the session “contaminated” – it will produce an
error, prevent the script from running, and prompt the user to consider
restarting the R session.</p>
<p>To illustrate what happens in a contaminated R session, I’ll do two
things that most R users would agree fit the definition of a
contaminated R environment: creating objects in the global environment
and attaching packages or environments:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/sessioncheck" class="external-link">sessioncheck</a></span><span class="op">)</span>                     <span class="co"># trigger check_packages</span></span>
<span><span class="va">my_data</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/data.frame.html" class="external-link">data.frame</a></span><span class="op">(</span>T <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span>, F <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="co"># trigger check_globalenv</span></span>
<span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/attach.html" class="external-link">attach</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">my_data</span><span class="op">)</span>                           <span class="co"># trigger check_attachments</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; The following objects are masked from package:base:</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; </span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt;     F, T</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These prior actions vary considerably in their riskiness. For the
example above, here’s a quick risk assessment</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Attaching packages</strong>. Yes, it’s possible that
attaching the <strong>sessioncheck</strong> package with
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library()</a></code> might cause problems, but I’ve tried to design it
safely so it likely won’t be a problem. Nevertheless, it is still
something where the script should notify the user. By design, the
typical use case for this package is to call
<code><a href="../reference/sessioncheck.html">sessioncheck::sessioncheck()</a></code>. In the normal course of
events you wouldn’t be writing <code><a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/sessioncheck" class="external-link">library(sessioncheck)</a></code> in
your script, so yes, the user should probably be informed, as an act of
politeness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adding to the global environment</strong>. Adding the
<code>my_data</code> data frame as a variable in the global environment
is not in itself a bad thing, but in practice when you’re running the
same script over and over in an interactive context – which is a thing
that data analysts have to do a lot, much more so than software
engineers – you can quickly build up a lot of “detritus”, bits and
pieces and objects left behind from code you tried out previously, and
over time it becomes a big problem. The user should definitely be
informed, because there are serious risk shere.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attaching a (malicious!) environment to the search
path</strong>. Attaching data sets using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/attach.html" class="external-link">attach()</a></code> has been
considered an extremely high-risk behaviour in R for a long time. It
creates chaos in the R session and the potential for horrific outcomes
is very high. The example I construced above is deliberately malicious,
just to highlight how bad it can be. If your script executes in an
environment when <code>attach(my_data)</code> has previously been
executed, you can no longer rely on R to make sensible judgements about
arithmetic:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">2</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="fl">2</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="fl">5</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="cn">T</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] TRUE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>On the face of it, R now believes that <code>2 + 2 = 5</code>. It
doesn’t actually believe this. The result happens because the prior call
to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/attach.html" class="external-link">attach()</a></code> ensures that you can no longer rely on the
shorthand that assumes <code>T == TRUE</code>. Indeed:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="cn">T</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] FALSE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and in fact:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="cn">T</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] FALSE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In an ideal world an R script should never be using <code>T</code> as
a shorthand for <code>TRUE</code> because it exposes the code to exactly
this problem, but unfortunately there is a <em>massive</em> amount of
old R code in current use that relies on the shortcut. The risk is
real.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Noting that the R session is now contaminated in three ways, we can
see what happens when <code><a href="../reference/sessioncheck.html">sessioncheck()</a></code> is called in a
contaminated environment:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">sessioncheck</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/sessioncheck.html">sessioncheck</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"error"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; Error: sessioncheck() detected the following issues:</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; - Objects in global environment: my_data</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; - Attached packages: sessioncheck</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; - Attached non-package environments: my_data</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; It may be necessary to restart R</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If this code were placed at the top of the user script, that script
would simply refuse to run in this contaminated environment. It would
produce an error that indicates which checks were performed, and lists
specific issues that were detected in each test. Not only that, because
this is an error (rather than a warning) it supplies a prompt to the
user that it may be necessary to restart R.</p>
<p>By way of comparison, consider what would happen if the traditional
<code>rm(list=ls())</code> approach were employed. Executing this code
will fix only one of the three problems:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/rm.html" class="external-link">rm</a></span><span class="op">(</span>list <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ls.html" class="external-link">ls</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The global environment is now clean, but any code that relies on
<code>T</code> to mean <code>TRUE</code> will now break, because the
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/rm.html" class="external-link">rm()</a></code> command has <em>not</em> detached the malicious
environment:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="cn">T</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] FALSE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Even though <code>rm(list = ls())</code> has been invoked, the R
session is not safe, and it will corrupt the behaviour of any script
that executes in this session. Importantly, notice that because
<code><a href="../reference/sessioncheck.html">sessioncheck()</a></code> is stricter than the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/rm.html" class="external-link">rm()</a></code>
approach, it still produces an error:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">sessioncheck</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/sessioncheck.html">sessioncheck</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"error"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; Error: sessioncheck() detected the following issues:</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; - Objects in global environment: [no issues]</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; - Attached packages: sessioncheck</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; - Attached non-package environments: my_data</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; It may be necessary to restart R</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Under normal circumstances the thing that the user – a human being –
would likely do next is restart the R session, and all of these problems
would go away. That is the intended way to use
<strong>sessioncheck</strong>. It is designed primarily for analysts who
design their code in a human-in-the-loop fashion. It is explicitly
<em>not</em> recommended for production code or any other situation
where R code is executed without direct human oversight.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because the author of this vignette is also the person
who created the contaminated R session, she also knows how to reverse
it:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/detach.html" class="external-link">detach</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"my_data"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/detach.html" class="external-link">detach</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"package:sessioncheck"</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">sessioncheck</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/sessioncheck.html">sessioncheck</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"error"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In general though, the job of cleaning the session or restarting it
should be reserved for the human analyst. Tools such as
<strong>sessioncheck</strong> should not attempt to do so.</p>
